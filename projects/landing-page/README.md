# Landing Page Project

This is my first project in which i had to use mostly Javascript to build a navigation bar.

The navbar builds dinamically based on the content of the page, it disappears when scrolling down and reappears when scrolling up.
The navbar will show which section is active based on the current viewport of the page and whenever an item on the navigation menu it's clicked, it will take you to the appropriate section and also make that section active/highlighted.
When scrolling below the page fold a scroll to top button will appear inside the navbar.
All the sections on the page are collapsible.
